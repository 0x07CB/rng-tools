    + Add pidfile control;
    + Improve manpage;
  * Rename package to rng-tools;

    + Drop partial DevFS support (patches are welcome to implement it

      initscript themselves (closes: #197506 since it is now irrelevant);
    + Standards-version 3.6.1;
    + Debhelper mode 4;
    + Rewrite README.Debian, and add section about Intel RNGs (contributions
      on other RNGs are welcome);
    + Rewrite copyright file to something that is valid;
    + Update initscript to something more proper for an important system
      service.

** Modular arch design

  goals:  input and output modules
  input:
    "pipe" mode: what we have now
    "via"  mode: userspace VIA RNG support 
             (Martin Peck <coderman@gmail.com>)
  output:
    "linux random" mode: what we have now
  ? "pipe" mode: sort of what rngtest does 
             (useful in rngd?)

* new rng-via usermode code that's a via
  entropy source, with all knobs.

Command line:
  rngd <input type> [input type options]


* Maybe define NDEBUG to remove assert() from
  the packaged binary?

Nextc:::
 - detect/store overflow on stat counters
 - stats: average only since last stat dump.

Ideas:
 - TCP/IP sink mode (multiple streams)
 - TCP/IP source mode, compatible with the above
 - Protect the above with good crypto (TLS).

Backburner:
 - i18n (including argp)
 - file input with deletion of used bits

Nextc:::
 - detect/store overflow on stat counters
 - stats: average only since last stat dump.

Ideas:
 - TCP/IP sink mode (multiple streams)
 - TCP/IP source mode, compatible with the above
 - Protect the above with good crypto (TLS).

Backburner:
 - i18n (including argp)
 - file input with deletion of used bits

.SH DESCRIPTION
This daemon feeds entropy from a hardware random number generator (HRNG) to the
kernel's entropy pool, after checking the data to ensure that it is suitably
random.
.PP
Entropy measures the uncertainty (randomness) contained in an unit of
information.  For the Linux kernel, this unit is a binary bit.  The kernel
keeps all the entropy it gathers from different sources in an entropy pool,
from which it drawns uncertainty to generate random numbers.
.PP
\fIrngd\fR works on blocks of 20000 bits at a time, using the FIPS 140-2 tests
to verify the randomness of the block of data.  If it is deemed random, the
block is fed back \fIrandom-step\fR*8 bits at a time to the kernel, until the
kernel's entropy pool is full.
.PP
When the entropy pool is full, the daemon will force-feed the kernel
\fIrandom-step\fR*8 bits of data every \fIfeed-interval\fR seconds,
to stir the entropy pool.  If the HRNG used by \fIrngd\fR is of very high
quality, this will improve the entropy of the pool.
.PP
The \fB\-f\fR or \fB\-\-foreground\fR options can be used to tell
\fBrngd\fR to avoid forking on startup.  This is typically used for
debugging.  The \fB\-b\fR or \fB\-\-background\fR options, which fork and put
\fBrngd\fR into the background automatically, are the default.
.PP
The \fB\-r\fR or \fB\-\-rng\-device\fR options can be used to select an
alternate source of entropy, instead of the default \fI@DEVHWRANDOM@\fR.
The \fB\-o\fR or \fB\-\-random\-device\fR options can be used to select
an alternate entropy output device, instead of the default \fI@DEVRANDOM@\fR.  
Note that this device must support the Linux kernel's \fI/dev/random\fR
ioctl API.
.PP
The \fB\-H\fR or \fB\-\-rng\-entropy\fR options should be used to inform 
\fIrngd\fR about the entropy per bit of data received from the input source.
.PP
The \fB\-B\fR or \fB\-\-rng\-buffers\fR options can be used to change the
number of buffers used by \fIrngd\fR.  Each buffer holds a block of 20000 bits
of data, which will be either approved or discarded by the FIPS tests.  
Decreasing the number of buffers below 3 can degrade rngd's performance.  
Increasing it above 3 will only help if you have very big bursts of entropy
usage that a larger number of buffers can accomodate.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-background\fR
Become a daemon (default)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-foreground\fR
Do not fork, nor detach from the controlling terminal
.TP
\fB\-o\fI file\fR, \fB\-\-random\-device=\fIfile\fR (default: @DEVRANDOM@)
Kernel device used for entropy output
.TP
\fB\-r\fI file\fR, \fB\-\-rng\-device=\fIfile\fR (default: @DEVHWRANDOM@)
Kernel device used for entropy input
.TP
\fB\-\-hrng=\fIname\fR
Selects known-good defaults for some HRNGs.  \fIhelp\fR lists all
known HRNGs.  You can override these defaults selectively with the
other options.
.TP
\fB\-H \fIn.n\fR, \fB\-\-rng\-entropy=\fIn.n\fR (default: 1.0)
Entropy per bit of input data.  This is a floating point
number between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
.TP
\fB\-B \fIn\fR, \fB\-\-rng\-buffers=\fIn\fR (default: 3)
Number of 20000 bit buffers to use
.TP
\fB\-s\fI n\fR, \fB\-\-random\-step=\fIn\fR (default: 64)
Number of bytes written to \fIrandom-device\fR at a time.  This
number should be even, and between 8 and 2500.  Setting it too high will
cause \fIrngd\fR to dominate the contents of the entropy pool.  Values 
above 256 are unlikely to increase performance.
.TP
\fB\-W\fI n\fR, \fB\-\-fill\-watermark=\fIn[%]\fR (default: 50%)
Once we start doing it, feed entropy to \fIrandom-device\fR until at least
\fIfill-watermark\fR bits of entropy are available in its entropy pool.
Setting this too high will cause \fIrngd\fR to dominate the contents of the
entropy pool.  Low values will hurt system performance during entropy 
starves.  \fIfill-watermark\fR can be specified either as an absolute number
of bits, or as a percentage of the total size of the entropy pool.
.TP
\fB\-t\fI n\fR, \fB\-\-feed-interval=\fIn\fR (default: 60)
If \fIfeed-interval\fR is not zero, \fIrngd\fR will force-feed entropy to the
random device even when the entropy pool is full every \fIfeed-interval\fR
seconds.  Setting this too low may cause \fIrngd\fR to dominate the contents of
the entropy pool.
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout=\fIn\fR
Deprecated, use \fI\-\-feed-interval\fR instead.
.TP
\fB\-T\fI n\fR, \fB\-\-rng-timeout=\fIn\fR (default: 10)
Time to wait for data to \fIstart\fR coming from the entropy source,
before giving up and aborting.  Zero disables this functionality, and
will cause \fIrngd\fR to wait forever for the entropy source.
.TP
\fB\-p\fI file\fR, \fB\-\-pidfile=\fIfile\fR (default: @PIDFILE@)
File to write PID to when running in background mode
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Give a short summary of all program options.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print program version

.SH WARNING
Depending on its settings, \fIrngd\fR can dominate the kernel's entropy pool,
by feeding it so much data, so often, that other sources of entropy are mostly
ignored or lost.  Do not to that unless you trust \fIrngd\fR's source of random
data ultimately.
.PP
Also, there is only so much bandwidth available from a HRNG, and it is often
not much.  Don't drain too much with too low a \fIfeed-interval\fR, or
\fIrngd\fR may not have enough data on its buffers when the kernel gets low on
entropy.

.SH STATISTICS
\fIrngd\fR will dump some statistics to its output channel hourly, or when
sent a \fBSIGUSR1\fR signal.  The output channel is either \fIstderr\fR when
in foreground mode, or \fIsyslog\fR when in background mode.
.PP
\fBBits received from HRNG source\fR is the number of bits received by
\fIrngd\fR from the entropy source.  \fBBits sent to kernel pool\fR is the
number of bits sent by \fIrngd\fR to the kernel, and \fBEntropy added to kernel
pool\fR is the number of bits of entropy in that mass of data that was informed
to the kernel.
.PP
\fBFIPS 140-2 successes\fR and \fBFIPS 140-2 failures\fR counts the number of
20000-bit blocks either accepted or rejected by the FIPS 140-2 tests.  The
other statistics show a breakdown of the FIPS 140-2 failures by FIPS 
140-2 test.  See the FIPS 140-2 document for more information.
.PP
\fBHRNG source speed\fR measures the speed of the entropy source, for reading
a 20000-bit block of data.  \fBFIPS tests speed\fR measures the speed of the
FIPS 140-2 tests for a 20000-bit block of data.
.PP
\fBLowest ready-buffers level\fR records the lowest number of ready buffers
(i.e. that can be fed to the kernel) hit so far.  If it gets to zero, you
may want to increase \fIrng-buffers\fR.  If it is always above 1, you may
want to decrease \fIrng-buffers\fR.
.PP
\fBEntropy starvations\fR counts the number of times the kernel asked
\fIrngd\fR for entropy, and \fIrngd\fR had none to give.  \fBTime spent starving
for entropy\fR records the time spent by \fIrngd\fR waiting for a buffer with
good entropy to become available, during such an episode.

.SH SIGNALS
\fIrngd\fR is multithreaded.  If the threading implementation shows up
as multiple \fIrngd\fR processes, signals should be sent to the process
listed in the \fIpidfile\fR.
.PP
\fBSIGTERM\fR terminates \fIrngd\fR cleanly.
.PP
\fBSIGUSR1\fR causes \fIrngd\fR to dump some statistics to its output
channel immediately.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
\fB0\fR if no errors happen.
.TP
\fB1\fR if \fIrng-source\fR is misbehaving.
.TP
\fB10\fR if there are problems with the parameters, or if \fIrngd\fR fails to lock the \fIpidfile\fR, or if \fIrng-device\fR cannot be opened.
.TP
\fB11\fR if an input/output error happens.
.TP
\fB12\fR if an operating system or resource starvation error happens.

.SH BUGS
The /dev/random driver in Linux kernels up to 2.4.28 inclusive (and probably
later ones too) has broken entropy accounting, and fails to do catrastrophic
reseeds correctly.  This has been fixed in Linux 2.6.
.PP
It is a very bad idea to shrink the capacity of the kernel entropy pool
with rngd running, as it may misbehave the next time the pool drains.  
Please restart rngd every time the kernel entropy pool size is changed.
